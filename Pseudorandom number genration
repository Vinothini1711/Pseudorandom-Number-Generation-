Aim:
To implement Pseudorandom Number Generation (PRNG) using the standard library in C.

Algorithm:
Start.
Include the necessary header files: stdio.h, stdlib.h, and time.h.
Use the time() function to seed the random number generator with the current time.
Prompt the user to enter the number of random numbers to generate.
Use a loop to generate and print the requested number of pseudorandom numbers using the rand() function.
End.
